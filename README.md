# Structured Adaptive Multi-Cycle (SAMC) Training Periodization

> **Training periodization that adapts to real-world constraints, rather than forcing the athlete to adapt to the plan.
**

SAMC is an intelligent training system that integrates structured periodization with adaptive, physiology-driven
decision-making. It continuously evaluates physiological data, individual dose–response training history, and subjective
readiness indicators to inform daily training choices. By synthesizing these signals, SAMC delivers context-aware,
sport-specific training recommendations designed to maximize performance progression while preserving long-term
adaptation capacity.
